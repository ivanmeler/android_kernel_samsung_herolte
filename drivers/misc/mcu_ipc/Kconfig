config MCU_IPC
     bool "MCU IPC Support"
     default n
	 help
	   This enables MCU_IPC driver to control the MCU_IPC Device.

	   MCU_IPC is the Mailbox which has 16 interrupts for TX/RX each
	   and 256 bytes memory for communicating messages.
	   AP and CP can share the messages through this device.

config MCU_IPC_LOG
	bool "MCU IPC LOG Support"
	depends on MCU_IPC
	default n
	help
	   This enables MCU_IPC log in GIC & mailbox interrupt handler.
	   It collects time stamp, interrupt counts and SFR information in memory.

config MCU_IPC_TEST
     bool "MCU_IPC driver test"
     depends on MCU_IPC
     help
	This enables MCU_IPC_TEST for checking mailbox at probe time.

config SHM_IPC
	bool "Shared Memory for IPC support"
	default n
	help
	This enables SHM_IPC driver to control the Shared memory
	for AP-CP Interface.
